# Team Profile Generator

## Description:
 I've created a Team Profile Generator within the node.js command-line to helps employers organize their managers and their teams with ease. Once employers run the node server in the command-line, they simply need to answer all prompts accordingly. When completed a html file will be generated for the manager assigned and a clean and polished list of the team will display on the web browser.
